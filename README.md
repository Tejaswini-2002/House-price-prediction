# Housing-price-prediction


Linear regression builds a model which establishes a relationship between features and targets.
The feature was house size and the target was house price.
For simple linear regression, the model has two parameters 𝑤 and 𝑏 whose values are 'fit' using training data.
Once a model's parameters have been determined, the model can be used to make predictions on novel data.
